**A convenient time tracking tool**. Formally, this seems not important and not necessary, of course, I already remember everything. When the value of the number of tasks increases, you gradually realize that somewhere there is a leakage of efficiency. Planning as it turns out to be a very important process for increasing productivity, tracking and planning based on the data obtained will allow you to evaluate and project the activity model without loss of resources.

The timer allows you to start monitoring the time, for this you need to press the key combination `z + x`, after this action the time countdown begins. After a second press, the accumulated time value will be generated in the table, under the timer. Further, it becomes possible to write down the name of the work, the number of processes performed during one iteration. Thus, a table of values ​​obtained during the workflow is formed.

**It is possible to divide the work into tasks** with the subsequent summation of their time into one work. For this, on the left of the tables, there is a checkbox after the selection of which a button appears, allowing you to summarize the work.

Suppose, after all the work done for better perception, or a convenient graphical representation for further work, you need to **sort** the values ​​obtained. This possibility exists, click the mouse button on the desired work and transfer it to the desired message.

**To transfer the generated table** to the editor, it is convenient for working with tables of data, it is possible to copy the entire table in one click. You need to click on the copy button.

If a new work day has started and you no longer need work from the previous day, you can **clean the entire table** or delete the selected job. To delete one job, click on it with the right mouse button and click delete.

## Additional functions
* If you accidentally close the tab, you will not lose the value from the table, the value accumulated on the timer itself will also be saved. Even if you notice that the tab is closed some indefinite time ago, you can not be afraid the time will not be irretrievably lost, the timer is clever, the timer has counted everything.
* You can change the background color, but it's better not to try.
